## Lab Exercise: Advanced State Transition Testing - The Smart Vending Machine
## Objective: To design comprehensive test cases using state transition testing for a complex system with multiple states, events, and error conditions.

### Scenario:

Consider a smart vending machine that sells snacks and drinks. It has the following states:

Idle: The machine is waiting for user input.
Selecting Item: The user is browsing and selecting an item.
Awaiting Payment: The user has selected an item and is about to pay.
Dispensing Item: The machine is dispensing the selected item.
OutOfStock: The selected item is out of stock.
Error: The machine has encountered an error (e.g., payment failure, mechanical malfunction).

### Events:

Select Item (Item ID): The user selects an item by its ID.
Insert Coin (Value): The user inserts a coin with a specific value.
Insert Card (Valid/Invalid): The user inserts a credit/debit card.
Cancel Transaction: The user cancels the transaction.
Dispense Complete: The item has been dispensed.
Stock Refilled (Item ID): The stock of an item is refilled.
Error Detected (Error Code): An error is detected.
Error Reset: The error is manually reset.


### State Transition Rules:

Idle:
"Select Item (Item ID)" transitions to "Selecting Item."
Selecting Item:
"Select Item (Item ID)" transitions to "Selecting Item" (allowing multiple selections).
"Insert Coin (Value)" or "Insert Card (Valid)" transitions to "Awaiting Payment."
"Cancel Transaction" transitions to "Idle."
If selected Item is out of stock, transition to "OutOfStock"
Awaiting Payment:
"Insert Coin (Value)" (accumulating sufficient payment) or "Insert Card (Valid)" transitions to "Dispensing Item."
"Insert Card (Invalid)" transitions to "Error."
"Cancel Transaction" transitions to "Idle."
Dispensing Item:
"Dispense Complete" transitions to "Idle."
"Error Detected (Error Code)" transitions to "Error."
OutOfStock:
"Stock Refilled (Item ID)" transitions to "Idle"
"Cancel Transaction" transitions to "Idle."
Error:
"Error Reset" transitions to "Idle."
Additional Challenges:

Payment Accumulation: The machine must accumulate coin values until the total payment is sufficient.
Inventory Management: The machine must track item stock levels.
Error Handling: The machine must handle various error conditions (e.g., invalid payment, mechanical failures).
Edge Cases:
What happens if the user selects an invalid item ID?
What happens if the user inserts too much money?
What happens if the machine runs out of stock while dispensing an item?
What happens if the error reset fails?
Tasks:

Advanced State Transition Diagram:
Create a detailed diagram that captures all states, events, and transitions, including error conditions.
Comprehensive State Transition Table:
Construct a table that includes all possible state transitions, including error conditions and edge cases.
Robust Test Case Design:
Design a comprehensive set of test cases that cover:
All valid and invalid transitions.
Boundary conditions (e.g., payment accumulation, stock levels).
Error conditions and recovery scenarios.
Edge cases and unexpected inputs.
Include test cases that test sequence of events.
Advanced Test Coverage Analysis:
Analyze the coverage of your test cases and identify any gaps.
Implement tests that test multiple transition paths.
Error Code Handling:
Create a table of error codes, and describe the expected result of each error code.
Key Discussion Points:

How does the complexity of the system affect test case design?
How can we ensure adequate coverage of error conditions?
How can we handle edge cases and unexpected inputs?
How can we test the sequence of events.
How can test automation be used to test complex state transitions?
